# arduino_NTC_lib
Welcome to my 1st Arduino library

I was looking for a nice library to use an NTC with variable Seriesresistor. I donÂ´t find one, so i createt one by myself.
The code is based on GarageLab.com code.
you find the post here:
http://garagelab.com/profiles/blogs/tutorial-using-ntc-thermistors-with-arduino

And now have fun wit my 1st lib.

Folder contents:

/example
  /NTC_Sensor
    NTC_Sensor.ino - Example Sketch
    
keywords.txt

library.properties

NTC.cpp

NTC.h


You need find everything in the Example Sketch.
It is really easy.
